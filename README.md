## 🧠 About Me

I'm an entry-level **Data Analyst** based in South Africa with a growing portfolio of real-world business analytics projects. I use tools like **SQL, Excel, Tableau, Power BI**, and increasingly **Python** to transform raw data into meaningful insights.

Certified in **Google Data Analytics** and **Microsoft Azure**, I specialize in breaking down complex data sets into actionable reports that non-technical stakeholders can understand and act on.

I believe data should **tell a story**—and that every chart, table, or query should drive decisions, not just decorate a slide.
